 The base unit for distance in the metric system is the meter. And to get a sense of how long a meter is, the average human being is between 1.5 and 2 meters tall. So 1.5 meters would be a not so tall person. But 2 meters would be quite tall. In fact, if you're 2 meters tall or above 2 meters tall, you might want to consider basketball. So for example, in this drawing right over here by Leonardo da Vinci a meter if this is.  an average sized male, a meter might be about, it would be more than halfway across his wingspan. So it might be about that much. And obviously, I am just roughly drawing this, just to give you a sense of how far a meter might be. And I just wrote a lowercase m here as really just a short way of writing meter. So you can imagine at the smaller things that you might want to measure with the meter are things like a human being. human beings. Hi.  or human beings wingspan. If you wanted to say, well, what are some of the larger things that you would want to measure with a meter, you might imagine something like the height of a skyscraper. So this right over here is the Empire State building once at one time, the tallest building in the world, now just a tall building in the world. And this is 443 meters tall. So this is starting to be kind of on the larger scale of things that you would want to measure with a meter. Now you're probably asking, well, what if I want to.  measure things that are even larger than that. Well, the metric system provides a prefix as to essentially say multiples of meters. And the unit of distance that is larger than the meter that is most typically used is the kilometer. So the kilometer, I've heard a few people say kilometer, but kilometer, I'll pronounce it kilometer, which is equivalent to 1,000 meters. And so when you're th-  thinking about kilometers, this is thinking about the distance within a city, this would be even the distance from one city to another city, even the radius of the planet is often measured in kilometers. And to once again get a sense of that, this right over here is a map of New York City, and right over here they give us the scale. This distance right over here is five kilometers. So five kilometers just to give us a sense of that.  And they wrote km for short. So 5km, this lowercase k, lowercase m is the shorthand for kilometers. This would be equal to, well, if 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, 5 kilometers is going to be 5 times as many. It's going to be 5,000 meters is this distance right over here. If you were to try to imagine 1 kilometer, it would be 1 fifth of that. So one kilometer on this map.  might look something like that. Now there's other units in the metric system that allow us to describe distances less than a kilometer but more than a meter. But they're not as typically used. But I'll list them here just so that you see that they exist. You have the hectometer or hectometer. It's so infrequently used that I really haven't heard a lot of people say it, which is equal to 100 meters. And you have the decometer or decameter. and I actually think.  I think it's decometer, decometer, decometer, which is 10 meters. And I'm going to write these in orange because they're not that frequently used. For example, no one would ever say, or it's not typical to hear someone say that the Empire State Building is 4.43 hectometers, or for them to say that this is 44.3 decometers. They would typically say that this is 443 meters. Now you're probably saying, OK, well, this is fine. I'm able to.  to using these prefixes on the meter, I'm able to describe distances that are larger than a meter, that are multiples of tens of the meter, or multiple of 100, or multiple of 1,000 of the meter. But what if I want to go smaller? Well, the metric system has units for that. And if we go just 1 tenth of a meter, this is not used as typically, but I'll write it here. The desimeter is 1 tenth of a meter. Or another way of saying it is one.  1 meter is equal to 10 decimeters, lowercase dm for short. Once again, this is not so typically used. But if we go one scale even below that, we get to the centimeter, which is a heavily used unit. We get to the centimeter. And here, the prefix centi means 100th. So this is 100th of a meter. Another way of thinking about it. one meter is equal.  to 100 centimeters. And if you wanted to imagine the scale of a centimeter, you could imagine this frog right over here on this person's hand might be several centimeters long. So a centimeter on this drawing might be around that distance. Now, if you want to measure things even smaller than that, we have another fairly common unit, and that is the millimeter. That is the millimeter. And the prefix milli here refers to 1,000th. So it's 1000.  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Thank you.  meters long. So a millimeter in this drawing right over here might be something like that. The important thing to realize is just or just to conceptualize is, well, you might want to use different units depending on the scale that you're measuring. And it's also useful to just realize what these typical prefixes refer to, because we're seeing it used in distance here. They're all based on the base unit of distance. But in other, when we're measuring volume or we're measuring other things in the metric system, the same prefixes.  also show up. So you see here when we're measuring distance, kilo refers to 1,000, a kilometer is literally 1,000 meters, hecto refers to 100, a hectometer, 100 meters, deca refers to 10, desi refers to 1 tenth. So decimeter, literally 1 tenth of a meter, centimeter, 100th, 100th of a meter, milli refers to 1,000th.
