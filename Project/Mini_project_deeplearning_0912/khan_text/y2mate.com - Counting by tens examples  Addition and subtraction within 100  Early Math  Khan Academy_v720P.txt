 Count by tens starting with 40. Fill in the blanks. So let's count by tens starting with 40. So 40 is four tens. So if we add 10 to that, we're going to get five tens, or 50. Now if we add 10 to that, we're going to get six tens, or 60. Now if we add 10 to that, we're going to get seven tens, or 70, but we don't have to type that in because they've already put that there for us. But then if we let's keep adding 10s.  So if we add 10 to 70, or 10 to 7 tens, we're going to have 8 tens, or 80. Add 10 to that, you're going to have 9 tens, or 90. And then we're done. Let's do one more of these. Count by tens, starting with 656. Fill in the blanks. Well, each time we want to add 110. So this 656, it's 600s, 5 tens, and 6 ones. Well now we're going to add 10 to it.  So instead of having five tens, we want to have six tens. So it's going to be 600, 66, 600s, six tens, and six ones. Let's add ten again. Well now, in the last one we had six tens, now we want to have seven tens. So it's going to be 676. Now let's add another ten. Well now we're going to have six hundreds, eight tens, and six. Or six hundred.  Now let's add 10 again. So now we're going to have 600s. Instead of 8 10s, we're going to have 9 10s and 6 ones. So 696. Now the next one's going to be interesting. We want to add another 10 to this. But how do we have, if we add another 10 to this, what do we have in the 10's place? Well one way to think about this is, You could view 609 tens as 69...  10s. So if you have 69 10s and you add one more 10, you're going to have 70 10s. So you're going to have 70 10s and 6 1s. So 696, you add 10 to it, you get 706. Once again, you could view this as 65 10s and 6 1s. So 65 10s, 66 10s, 67 10s, 68 10s, 69 10s, and seven  7010s, 706.
