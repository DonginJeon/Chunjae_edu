 There were 10 sharks at the reef. And we see there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 sharks, just like they told us. Two sharks swam away. I was going to say ran away. They swam away. How many sharks are left? So let's think about it. There were 10 sharks at the reef. And two of them swam away. So how many sharks are left? How many  sharks are left, well, what's 10 minus 2 going to be equal to? Well, we can look up here if we had 10 pictures of sharks and we were to take away 1 and then 2, how many are going to be left? Well, we see we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. So 10 minus 2, 10 taking away two sharks, the two sharks that Swam away is going to be equal to...  8.
