 Let's count together from 0 to 19. So we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And now we go to the two-digit numbers. And then we go to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.  16, 17, 18, and 19. Now why did I do this? Well, the whole point of this is to see a pattern here, especially in these two digit numbers. What do we see is true about all of these numbers that are, you could think of them, they're being in their teens. Well, they all, you might see, have a one as their first digit. And that one is sitting in what we'll call the tens place. it literally says that each of these numbers.  that one represents a 10. What do I mean by that? Well, if we go up to 10 over here, this is telling us that this one represents 10, and then this zero represents zero ones. So 10 is 10 plus zero. You say, oh, well, what's the big deal? We already knew that any number plus zero is that number again. But I think you'll see the pattern as we go into these other numbers. So 11 is equal to, So this one, the yellow one, represents two.  10, and then this pink one represents 1. And then 12. 12, this yellow one represents 10, and then this pink two represents 2. Or you could think of it as this yellow one says this is 1, 10. So we have a 10 right over there, and this is two 1s. And you have two right over there. And we can keep going. I think you see the pattern. 13 is 10 plus 3. 13 is 10.  plus 3, 14 is equal to 10 plus 4. Plus 4, 15 is equal to 10 plus 5. And I encourage you to pause the video now and try to finish the rest. Try to write 16, 17, 18, and 19 as 10 plus some other number. And really just make sure that you understand the pattern that's happening. So let's do that. So 16, so I can even write them all like this. they're all going to be 10, 10.  plus something. So 16 is 10 plus 6. 17 is 10 plus 7. 18 is 10 plus 8. And 19 is 10 plus 9. And when you write it out like this, it becomes pretty clear that this 1 in each of these numbers represents 10. And then the digit on the right, that just represents that many 1s.
