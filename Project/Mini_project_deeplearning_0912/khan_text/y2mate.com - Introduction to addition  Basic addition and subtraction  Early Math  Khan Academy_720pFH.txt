 Let's think about what it means to add numbers. So let's start with 1, 1 plus 1. What is this going to be equal to? One way to think about this is we have one thing, and that thing will be a purple circle. So let me...  Put that here. So that's this one thing. I'm just going to represent it with a purple circle. And I'm going to add another one thing. And since this is in blue, I'll make that other circle. I'll make that in blue as well. So let me put that right over here. So 1 plus 1. 1 plus 1. How many total circles do I now have? Well, I now have two circles. I now have two circles. one plus one.  is equal to, is equal to two. Okay, you're saying, all right, Sal, that makes sense. Let's do this with larger numbers. So let's say we wanna know what equals, and I'll put a question mark over here. So question mark, what equals, so something is equal to, is equal to, to, let's say, two, two.  2 plus 3. Something is equal to 2 plus 3. What is this something going to be? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own. Well, you could view this as I have two objects, and then we're going to add another three objects. How many total objects would I have? So you have your two objects, which I'll use purple circle.  again, so let me, so we have one and two purple circles. This is the two right over here and then to that we're going to add three more, three more circles and I'll represent those in blue because we wrote the three here in blue. So that is one, two and three. So how many times do I have to do this?  any total circles do we now have? Well, we could count them. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In fact, let me count that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 circles. So 2 plus 3, 2 things plus another 3 things, are 5 things. So our question mark right over here is equal to 5. So instead of writing that question mark right over here, let me clear that out. I  I could say 5 is equal to, I could write down that 5 is equal to 2 plus 3.
