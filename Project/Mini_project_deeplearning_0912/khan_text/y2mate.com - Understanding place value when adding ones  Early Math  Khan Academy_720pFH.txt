 So this right over here is one way to represent the number 37. The number 37 has a 3 right over here in the tens place. And so this 3 literally represents 3 tens. Notice this is a 10 here, this is a 10 here, and this is a 10 here. 3 tens, or 30. You see, each of these tens, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  9, 10. Now the 7 is in the 1's place. It literally represents 7 1's. And you see that right over here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So you can say that 37 is equal to 3 10's. We'll do this in the purple color. It's equal to three tens plus plus.  plus seven ones. Plus seven ones. Now what if I wanted to add something to 37? What would 37, 37, 37 plus, plus two be equal to? How many tens and how many ones? Well, think about it, we're now going to add two. So we're adding.  two ones, so we're gonna add one and two. So now we still have three tens, so let's write that down. So we still have three tens, but now we have a different number of ones. We now have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. We now have nine ones, or another way to think about it, seven ones plus two ones is nine ones. So let me write that down. So plot.  plus nine ones. Or another way to think about it is 37, 30, let me do it right the same way, 37, 37 plus two is equal to three tens. So I could write this as 30 and then nine ones. Is equal to 39. And that's exactly what we have here. We have 30, this is the three tens, and then we have nine ones, which is...  is 39, 39 squares.
