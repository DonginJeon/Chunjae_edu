 How do we count the flowers? So this first choice, they go one, two, three. And then they don't count this one, and then they skip it, and they go four, five, six. And then they skip this one again, and then they say seven, eight. That's not how you count flowers. You would say this is four, this is five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. So this first choice is not right. Now the second one looks better. One, two, three, four.  They didn't skip this one. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That one looks good, so I'll click right over here and check my answer. How do we count the mice? Let's see, one, two, this isn't the third mouse. This is the second mouse.
