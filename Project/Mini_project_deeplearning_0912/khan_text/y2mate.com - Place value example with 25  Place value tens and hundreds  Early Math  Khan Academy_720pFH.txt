 What I want to do in this video is think a little bit about what numbers really represent. So let's say someone were to write down the number 25. So what does this really mean? Well the 5 here, this is in the 1's place, so it literally represents 5 1's. And this 2 right over here, this is in the 10's place. This is in the 10's place, let me write that down, that's the 10's place, that's the 1's place. So this represents...  2 tens. What do I mean by that? Well, another way to write this is this 2. This represents 2 tens. So let me write that down. This is equal to 2 tens plus 5 ones. Now, what are 2 tens? Well, that's literally, if you could imagine a 10 being a block of 10 things. So you could imagine if this is a 10.  and right over here, let me copy and paste this. So copy, so this is going to be the same thing. This is going to be equal to, you have your two 10s. So one 10 and two 10s. So you have your two 10s. So that's your two 10s right over there that really represents 20 plus your five ones. Plus, plus your five ones. Well, if this is a one right over here, members.  representing it as kind of one vertical bar. Five ones are going to look like. We're going to have one, two, two. I think you see where this is going. Three, four, four, and five. And five. And so these are all different ways of representing the same quantity.  25 is 2 tens and 5 ones. This 2 is in the tens place. The 5 is in the ones place. So 2 tens plus 5 ones. So you can view this as 2 groups of 10 plus 5 groups of, or 5 ones right over here. And what is this going to be the same thing as? Well, 2 groups of 10, this is the same thing as 20. And this over here is equal to 5. So once again, all ways to represent twi-  25. You could view this as 2 tens plus 5 ones, or you could view this as 20. Let me write this down. 25. You could view, because this 2 is 2 tens, that represents 20 plus the 5 ones.
