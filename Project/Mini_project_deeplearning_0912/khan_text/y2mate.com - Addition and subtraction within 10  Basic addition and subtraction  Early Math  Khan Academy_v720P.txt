 So we're given four different equations here and each of them have a blank and we need to fill in that blank with a missing number. So let's do each of these. So on the left hand side of this equation we have one plus four and that is equal to, so one plus four is the same thing as, well one plus four is five. If we take four and if you add one more you're gonna have five. So now we finish that one because 1 plus 4 is the same thing as 5.  Now here we're saying four plus something is the same thing as five. Well we just figured out that one plus four, or four plus one, is the same thing as five. So four plus one is five. So notice here we have the equation. Four plus one is the same thing as five. Equals means that what's on the left is the same thing as what you have on the right. Now we have blank plus two is equal to five. So what plus two is the same thing as five?  Well, three plus two is equal to five, or five is equal to three plus two. Now you go here. Well, now they have three plus blank is equal to five. Well, we already figured it out, because three plus two is equal to five. So we could write three plus two is equal to five. Then we could check ourselves, and then we could keep going. So now we have some subtraction. So what's the same thing as nine minus three? So if I have nine things, and if I were to take away three of them, I'm going to have six left.  nine minus three is the same thing as six. 10 minus blank is equal to six. So what do I have to take away from 10 in order to have six left over? Well, if I take four away from 10, I'm going to have six left over. Now, something minus one is the same thing as six. Well, seven minus one is going to be equal to six. And then we get 8 minus blank is equal to 6.  So how many do I have to take away from eight in order to get to six? Well if I take away one, I'm gonna get seven. If I take away two, I'm going to have six. So eight minus two is equal to six.
