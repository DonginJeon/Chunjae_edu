 When counting by fives starting from 170 hot, when counting by fives starting from 179, which numbers will you say? So let's do that. Let's start with 179 and let's count by fives. So 179 plus five is equal to what? Well, 179, one way I think about it, 179 plus five is the same thing as 179 plus one plus four. And I added one just so I get to one.  180. So this part right here is equal to 180. So it's going to be the same thing as 180 plus 4. So it's equal to 184. Now let's keep going. So let's put, we started at 179. Then we go to 184. Then if we want to add 5 to that, well 184 plus 5, we add 5 in the ones place, we get 189. Now if we add 5 again, we're gonna do just what we had over here.  So here, 189 plus 5, that's the same thing as 189 plus 1 plus 4. 189 plus 1 is 90, or 190, plus 4 is 194. So this is going to be 194. And then if you add 5, you're going to get 199. I just added the 5 to this 4 here in the ones place. Now if you add five again, let's see what...  This would be 199 plus five is the same thing as 199 plus one plus four. So 199 plus one is 200 plus four is 204. So let's see which of these numbers we see so far. So we saw 184. We see 189. We didn't see 186. We saw 194. We saw 199. And we saw 200.  and four, and we are done.
