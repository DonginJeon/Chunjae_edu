 We're told Lulu was packing for a trip. She put her clothes inside of her suitcase in two rows with five shirts in each row. So I guess what they're drawing here is this is her open suitcase. And each of these squares is a shirt. And you can see there's one, two, three, four, five shirts in the first row, and then another five shirts in the second row. And then they ask us which expression, or I guess we say expressions, Could we use to find the total number?  of shirts Lulu packed. And so pause this video and think about which of these expressions could we use to find the total number of shirts. And I'll give you a hint, it could be more than one of these. Alright, now let's work through this together. So before I even look at these choices, I can look up here and say, okay, I have five in that first row, and then I have five in the second row. So I have two groups of five. So I could view this as five plus five total shirts. And you can see that's this.  choice right over here. Now are there other ways to view this? Instead of viewing it as two groups of five, what if we viewed as five groups of two? That's one group of two, that's another group of two, a third group of two, a fourth group of two, and a fifth group of two. So you could view it as these two plus these two plus these two plus these two plus these two. Five groups of twos. Or you you can see.  five twos, which we have right over here. We have five twos and we're adding them all together. So I like this choice as well.
