 Let's think about what seven plus six is. And I encourage you to pause this video and think about it on your own. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. So let's think about it. We could view this as seven objects plus six more objects and then think about how many total objects we had. So for example, we could view it as seven, say, tomatoes. So one tomato, two tomatoes, three tomatoes, four tomatoes four tomatoes  5, 6, and 7. And then to that, we're going to add six more objects. And let's say they're blueberries, and we care about the total amount of fruit. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Six blueberries. Now, how many total pieces of fruit door.  So I have it all now. Well, I started with seven, so that's seven. And so if I keep counting, this is seven. So this is going to be eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, and 13. So I now have a total of 13 pieces of fruit. 13 pieces of fruit. Now what are other weights that we could have thought about this? Well, we could have also done it on a number line. So let's draw ourselves a number line. do it in.  So let's say we have a number. Let me do this in a color that I haven't used yet, actually. So let's say I have a number line. So just like that. And I could start the number line at 7. I could start at 7. And I'm going to add six more. I'm going to move six more up the number line. So let's do this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And of course, I could keep going. It's going to be 8, 9, 10.  11, 12, 13. And of course, you could keep on going. But 7 plus 6, you could visualize this as starting at 7 and then making six jumps up the number line. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Either way, we get to 13. Another way to think about it is, well, look. We started with seven.  we added three to get to 10, and so we have to add another three, which gets us to 13. And that really goes to the heart of what the number 13 represents. The number 13 has a one as its left digit. This digit is in the tens place, so it literally represents 110, so it's 110 plus three plus three ones. Thank you.  and you see that right over here. So when I added the pieces of fruit, this right over here is one group of 10. So that's one group of 10. And so we had to add three to get to that one group of 10. And then, so we kind of filled that bucket, and then we had three more. So we're left, when you add seven plus six, you fill one whole group of 10, and then you have three ones left over. So this is the three ones right over.  So another way you could think about it is 7 plus 6 is the same thing as 10 plus 3, which of course is 13. So this is the same thing. 1, 10 is 10 plus 3 plus 3 1s. 13. Either way, you look at it.
