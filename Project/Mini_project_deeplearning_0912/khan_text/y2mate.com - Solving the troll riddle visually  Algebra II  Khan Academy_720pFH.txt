 Where we left off, we were trying our very best to get to the castle and save whomever we were needing to save. But we had to cross the bridge and the troll gave us these clues because we had no money in our pocket. And if we don't solve his riddle, he's gonna push us into the water. So we are under pressure. And at least we made some headway in the last video. We were able to represent his clues mathematically as a system of equations. What I want to do in this video is think about  or whether we can solve for the system of equations. And you will see that there are many ways of solving a system of equations. But this time I want to do it visually, because at least in my mind, it helps really kind of get the intuition of what these things are saying. So let's draw some axes over here. Let's draw an F-axis, that's the number of fives that I have, and let's draw a T-axis, that is the number of tens I have. And let's say that this right over here, This right over here is 510.  that is 1,010. And let's say that this is, sorry, that's 500 fives, that's 1,050. This is 510s, 510s, and this is 1,010s. So let's think about all of the combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this first equation. If t, if we have no 10s, then we're gonna have 900 fives. So if we have no 10s, we're gonna have 900 fives. So that looks like it's right.  about there. So that's the point 0,10's 900,905. But what if it went the other way? If we have no 5's, we're going to have 900,10's. So that's going to be the point 910,05's. So all the combinations of F's and T's that satisfy this are going to be on this line. Are going to be on that line right over there. And I just draw a dotted line just because it's easier for me to draw it straight. So that represents...  all the F's and T's that satisfy the first constraint. Obviously, there's a bunch of them. So we don't know which is the one that is actually what the troll has. But lucky for us, we have a second constraint. This one right over here. So let's do the same thing. In this constraint, what happens if we have no tens? If tens are 0, then we have 5F is equal to 5,500. Let me write the table here, because this is a little bit more involved. It's a little bit more involved. So for the second equation, 10s and 5s.  If I have no 10s, if I have no 10s, I have 5F is equal to 5500, F will be 1100. F is, I must have 1100 fives. If I have no fives, if I have no fives, and this is zero, and I have 10T is equal to 5500, that means I have 550, 550 10s. So let's plot both of this point. T equals zero, F is 1100, that's right about there. So that is 0, 1100 is on the line.  that represents this equation, and that when f is 0, t is 550. So let's see. This is about, see, this would be 6, 7, 8, 9. So 550 is going to be right over here. So that is the point. 550, comma 0. And all of these points, let me try to draw a straight line again. I can do a better job than that. I can do a better job than that. So all of these...  The points are the points, let me try one more time. One more time, we want to get this right. We don't want to get pushed into the water by the troll. So there you go, that looks pretty good. So every point on this blue line represents an F, T combination that satisfies the second constraint. So what is an F and T, or number of fives and number of tens that satisfy both constraints? Well, it would be a point that is sitting on both of the lines. And what is a point that is...  sitting on both of the lines. Well, that's where they intersect. This point right over here is clearly on the blue line, and it is clearly on the yellow line. And what we can do is, if we drew this graph really, really, really precisely, we could see how many fives that is and how many 10s that is. And if you look at it very precisely, and actually I encourage you to graph it very precisely, and come up with how many fives and how many 10s that is. Thank you.  When we do it right over here, I'm going to eyeball it. If we look at it right over here, it looks like we have about 700 fives. 700 fives, and it looks like we have about 210s. And this is based on my really rough graph. But let's see if that worked. 700 plus 200, 700 plus 200 is equal to 900. And if I have 700 fives, 700, let me write this down. Five times 700 is going to be the value of the fives, which is 3500.  dollars, and then 10 plus 10 times 200, 10 times 200, which is $2,000, is the value of the tens. And if you add up the two values, you indeed get $2,500. So this looks right. And so we can tell the troll, troll. I know. I know how many 5 and 10 dollar bills you have. You have $705 bills and you have $210 bills.  The troll is impressed and he lets you cross the bridge to be the hero or heroine of this fantasy adventure.
