 Let's say that you're throwing a party and as we all know, any party needs a sufficient number of monkeys. Right now you have 10 monkeys. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But you would like to have 18 monkeys. So how many more monkeys do you need in order to have 18 monkeys? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own before I work through it. So remember the goal here  was is to get to the goal here, let me write this way, the goal here is to get to 18, 18 monkeys. Now what do we know about the number 18? Well the number 18, you have this one right over here in the tens place, so that literally represents one, 10, and then this eight represents eight ones. So, plus.  8 ones, and that's the same thing as saying 1, 10, 1, 10, that's just a 10 right over there, and 8 ones, that's just 8. So 18 is the same thing as 10 plus 8. So if we start with 10 monkeys, which is how many we have started with, how many more do we need to get to 18? Well if you start at 10, you need 8 more to get to 18. And we We can verify that visually if we...  like. So let's see, let me copy and paste one of these monkeys. Copy. So this is 10. So now let's get to 18. So 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, Thank you.  18. So how many more did we add? Well, once again, we started with this 10 right over here. Let me box them off. We started with these 10 monkeys. So that's one group of 10 right over there. So we started with the 10. And then we added eight more monkeys. One, two, three, four, five.  So we started with 10. We added eight more monkeys to get to 18. And once again, how did we first think about that? Well, 18 is 1, 10 plus 8 ones, or 10 plus 8.
