 Gavin has these horses. Is the number of horses in each picture below more than, less than, or same as the number of horses Gavin has? So let's first look at how many horses Gavin has. He has one, two, three, four, five, six horses. Okay, so let's remember that. and let's compare each of these amounts of horse.  to the six horses that Gavin has. So let's look over here. So over here, we have one, two, three, four, five, six horses. So this is the same number that Gavin has. They're just arranged differently. So this is the same. We'll put it in the same-as bucket. Now here we have one, two, three, four, five horses. So this is less than the c-  six horses that Gavin has. Five is less than six. Here, and I can just look at this and see that there's more than six, but we can count them. We have one, two, three, four, five, and then another five, that's going to be 10. Or we can say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Well, 10 is more than six. 10 is more than six, so we'll put it in the more than bucket. Now here, we have four and four. Well that's going to be...  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Again, that is more than the 6 up here. That's more than 6. And then here we have 1, 2, 3, 4 horses. Well, 4 is less than 6. So I will put that in the less than bucket. Just like that. And let's check our answer to see how we did. Thank you.  We got it right.
