 Amelia started a puzzle at 12.56 p.m. and solved it at 1.33 p.m. How long did it take Amelia to solve the puzzle? So we can see she started at 12.56 p.m. and ended at 1.33 p.m. These are both p.m. and we'll assume on the same day. So that means it didn't take all the way from morning to night. They're both afternoon. So she started.  at 12.56 and we want to know how long it takes to get to 1.33 when she finished the puzzle. Well, from 12.56 to 1.00 p.m., we can figure out how long that is. That's only four minutes. There's only four minutes between 12.56 and 1.00. And then to get from one all the way to one  1.33 pm is another 33 minutes. So Amelia worked for four minutes plus another 33 minutes after 1 o'clock. She worked for four minutes before 1, 33 minutes after 1. So she worked for a total of 37 minutes on her puzzle before solving it.
