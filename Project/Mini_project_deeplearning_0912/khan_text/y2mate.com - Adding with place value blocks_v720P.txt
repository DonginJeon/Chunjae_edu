 What we want to do in this video is think about what is equal to eight plus six. And to help us out, we have eight blocks shown right over here, and we have another six blocks shown in this pink color. So pause this video and see if you could figure it out. So there's a lot of ways to approach it, but one way that I like to do it is, let me see if I can make a group of 10 out of some of these blocks and then see how many of them are left over. So if I want to make a group of 10, I would use all of them.  these eight, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and then I would need two more, and I could get those two more from this six year, and then I would have one, two, three, four left over. And to see what that looks like, you can see that we could take all of the eight and then two of the six to make a group of 10, and so I set that up as a whole bar. So we know that our answer is going to have one 10, So this tells us that that is right.  this way, one, 10. And then how many ones? Well, we can see that right over here. We have four ones left over. So that is four ones. So if we think about place value, that's one, 10, and four ones, or 14. We have 10 and another four, which is the same thing as 14.
